# multi-repath
Repathing tool for maya built using Pymel


This tool is intended for working across multiple networks. It repaths all references by looking for files with the same name in a specified folder address. Paths are absolute however this can support relative paths as long as you import the environment in to the script. It is by no means perfect so please forgive any errors that may happen and do report them so I can try to adjust this script in the future. If anyone does want to build on this code then please do.

When running the script click skip on the reference dialogue that appears as I still have not figured out a way to bypass this.
